			<p id="aural1">Sound carries with it an imprint of the space in which it originates. Like any other space, the Hagia Sophia has a characteristic sound. Because of its dimensions and physical features, sound produced within the Hagia Sophia carries for a very long time. There are established methodologies to try to isolate the effects that a space has on acoustic signals. What follows here is a step-by-step account of how we captured the acoustics of Hagia Sophia.</p>

Red areas indicate sound components with high energy. Note how these components are smeared by Memorial Church in the "wet", reverberant signal.</p>

The graph to the right depicts the impulse response of Stanford University's Memorial Church. The following video of a balloon pop shows how this impulse response was recorded.</p>

Using a mathematical operation called <em><strong>convolution</strong></em>, we were able to synthesize the Greek hymn <em>Trisagion</em>, recorded in a studio, with the reverberant qualities of Memorial Church.</p>
